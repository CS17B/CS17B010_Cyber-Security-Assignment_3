Looking from an overall perspective, we can conclude the blowfish algorithm is more 
secure than DES, and produces best results for less processing time and rounds.
To increase the key size of the blowfish algorithm from 128 to 448, it gives more
privacy to the messages and provides high end data security when transmitting over
any unsafe medium.
