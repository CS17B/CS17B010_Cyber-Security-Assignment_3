# CS17B010_Cyber-Security-Assignment_3

Question: 1
DES implementation in c
To DES.c main file the input file is ("input.txt") and key input is ("key.txt")
And it will give output encrypted message.
And also decrypted message.
The input is first converted into bits format and stored in  "bits.txt"
And "bits.txt" is passed into algorithm and converted into cipher text and stored in "cipher.txt"(basically a encrypted text)
And "Cipher.txt" is a input on decryption side and passed to decryption algorithm and will produce output in "decrypted.txt"
And "decrypted.txt" will be in bits format and is converted into plain text and stored in "result.txt"(bascially which is a orginal text)




Question 2
DES vs BLOWFISH
Discussed about difference in key sizes,block size,speed of algotithm,no of rounds,
number of s-boxes,structure used in the algorithm,block structure diagram, and the 
Developed year of both algorithms,and type of cipher used


Question 3
MICROSOFT SDL vs OWASP CLASP
Discussed about OWASP CLASP which is similar to microsoft SDL
And differences in stages of their life cycles,applicability,nature of code,code integrity check,
suitabilty,assessments,application testing and assessmentseperate privacy requirement evaluation,
anf finally nature of activites
